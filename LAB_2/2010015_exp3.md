## 1. Introduction:
Git is a distributed version control system that lets multiple users collaborate on a project efficiently. It maintains a history of changes, supports branching, and ensures seamless teamwork.

## 2. Fundamental Git Operations
### Initializing a New Repository
- **Purpose:** To start tracking your project's files with Git.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
### Cloning an Existing Repository
- **Purpose:** To copy an existing project from a remote server.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/I-yasir/repo.git
  ```
### Checking the Status of the Repository
- **Purpose:** To display the state of your working directory.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
### Adding Files to Staging Area
- **Purpose:** To prepare files for a commit.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git add filename
  git add .
  ```
### Committing Changes
- **Purpose:** To save staged changes in the local repository.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add descriptive message here"
  ```

## 3. Branching and Merging
### Creating and Switching:
- create branch
```bash
git branch new-feature
```
- Switch to a Branch
```bash
git checkout new-feature
```
### Merging:
```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

## 4. Advanced Commands:
- Stashing changes:
```bash
git stash
git stash apply
```
- Viewing Commit History:
```bash
git log
```
- Reset to previous commit:
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
- Reverting Changes:
```bash
git revert commit-id
```


## 5. Collaboration with Git:
### Remote Repo management:
- add a remote repo:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/I-yasir/repo.git
```
- View Remote Repositories:
```bash
git remote -v
```
- Fetch Changes without Merging:
```bash
git fetch origin
```
- Pull and Merge Changes:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

## 6. Conclusion:
This lab covered essential Git commands, highlighting their practical applications for managing code repositories. Mastering these commands is crucial for efficient project collaboration and version control.
